# C_Trie

A basic c project impelementing trie data structure, this was the 4th assingment in my c course.

Information about trie: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie

**version 1.0.3** 
Finished assingment.

Trie support insertion (in O(n) time).
(update 1.0.2):
Trie support contains  (in O(n) time).
tests for inserstion and contains.
(update 1.0.3):
Trie support delete    (in O(n) time).
delete only once (if a word was inserted twice it will just take the count down)

frequency.c: is an example of a use for trie, insert a text (only english letters) to the trie
             and print the trie in alphabetic order or reversed order.
             explantion on how to run the program in the wiki section.

Please read the wiki for a better understanding on how to use the trie and how I implemented it.
